                A complete event streaming and management platform for the
                real-time enterprise. The PubSub+ Platform helps enterprises
                design, deploy, and manage event-driven architectures (EDAs)
                across hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, and IoT environments, so they
                can be more integrated and event-driven.

              The PubSub+ Cloud Console is the "single pane of glass" that gives
              you access to the PubSub+ Platform—a complete event streaming and
              management platform.<br /><br />

              From one console, you can:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Deploy and link brokers to form a global, dynamically-routed
                event mesh
              </li>
              <li>Monitor event mesh performance</li>
              <li>Define, manage and govern events</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Event Streaming</h3>

            <p>
              PubSub+ Mission Control gives you access to event broker services
              that give you all the messaging features you need, while Solace
              takes care of deploying and operating your service. We engineer it
              all to be secure, resilient, and cost-optimized so you can focus
              on building applications and your EDA. In addition to this, you
              can manage your event broker services whether they are located in
              the cloud or on-premises, easily visualize and design event
              meshes, securely centralize the management of your EDA, and easily
              scale to drive your EDA forward.
            </p>

            <h3>Event Insights</h3>

            <p>
              With PubSub+ Insights, we do the work to provide curated
              dashboards, easy-to-understand visualizations based on historical
              and real-time metrics, and timely notifications about your event
              broker services. Advanced monitoring helps you to better manage
              your services as your EDA scales, and an integrated email
              framework alerts you when key metrics fall outside of your
              established thresholds.
            </p>

            <h3>Event Management</h3>

            <p>
              PubSub+ Event Portal provides event management services that give
              you the power to create, design, share, and manage your events
              whether they come from PubSub+ Platform event brokers or other
              streaming technologies (e.g., Kafka). The Event Portal offers
              runtime discovery and cataloging of events, schemas, and
              application interactions. You can easily generate code and
              documentation, validate events, and apply API management policies
              for applications in your EDA.

              PubSub+ event brokers power an event mesh, a modern messaging
              layer that can be deployed across every environment and component
              of the distributed enterprise, to stream events across them all.

              Each messaging API has online documentation and samples for
              application developers to reference. There are also Get Started
              tutorials that you can find at the Developer Tutorials.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the Node.js API and JavaScript API, all the sample code can be
              found on solace-samples-nodejs and solace-samples-javascript
              GitHub pages.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the JCSMP, Java RTO, C and .NET APIs, the samples are
              available by extracting the the corresponding distribution
              package:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When using the JCSMP or Java RTO APIs, follow the build
                instructions in the README file found in the samples directory.
              </li>
              <li>
                When using the C or .NET APIs, follow the build instructions in
                the README file found in the ex directory.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once a sample is successfully built, it can be run. In the
                following sub-sections, when the bolded command is entered, the
                sample is run, and the subsequent output should be displayed.
              </li>
            </ul>
